## Stats / numerical modeling interview questions
* How much "normal" risk does COVID-19 represent: https://medium.com/wintoncentre/how-much-normal-risk-does-covid-represent-4539118e1196
* What's the probability that someone in your childen's school is positive for Coronavirus: https://twitter.com/wtgowers/status/1239482689452941312?s=12
* What's the optimal procedure for testing a group of n people (given unlimited tests), to minimize the time to determine who is positive and who is negative, given the following:
    * unlimited tests / test processing capacity
    * each test takes t time
    * current baseline pctg of positive results m% (ie m% of ppl test positive)
    * test false positive rate is: j%
    * test false negative rate is: k%
    * source: https://twitter.com/robertwiblin/status/1241088888552263680?s=12
* How much difference does it make if the test used to send people into quarantine is bad?: https://paulromer.net/covid-sim-part3/
    * TLDR: "It shouldn’t really come as a surprise, but any policy that puts people who are infectious into quarantine will slow the spread of the disease."
* Discuss how estimating Case Fatality Rates (CRF) is affected by differences in testing regimes (eg. across countries): https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/

* How important are so-called “superspreader” events, for the transmission of Coronavirus?: https://twitter.com/adamjkucharski/status/1245336637497913345?s=12
* How do different testing regimes affect estimates of R and case counts?: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/
* Antibody tests and Bayes' rule: how do you compute the P(you are + for COVID | you test + for COVID), given an antibody test with a certain *sensitivity* (ie probability that a person tests positive if they *are* infected), and a certain *specificity* (ie probability that a person tests negative given that they *are* negative)?
