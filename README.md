## Stats / numerical modeling interview questions
* How much "normal" risk does COVID-19 represent: https://medium.com/wintoncentre/how-much-normal-risk-does-covid-represent-4539118e1196
* What's the probability that someone in your childen's school is positive for Coronavirus: https://twitter.com/wtgowers/status/1239482689452941312?s=12
* What's the optimal procedure for testing a group of n people (given unlimited tests), to minimize the time to determine who is positive and who is negative, given the following:
    * unlimited tests / test processing capacity
    * each test takes t time
    * current baseline pctg of positive results m% (ie m% of ppl test positive)
    * test false positive rate is: j%
    * test false negative rate is: k%
